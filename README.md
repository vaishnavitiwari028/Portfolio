## Full Stack Developer |

ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm [Vaishnavi Tiwari], a passionate and versatile full-stack developer with a love for turning ideas into functional, user-friendly applications.

## About Me

ðŸš€ I thrive in the fast-paced world of web development, seamlessly bridging the gap between front-end aesthetics and back-end logic. My toolset includes:

## Tech Stack

- **Front-end:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js
- **Back-end:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Databases:** MySQL, MongoDB
- **DevOps:** Git, Docker

I'm not just limited to these technologies; I'm always excited to explore new tools that can enhance my development process.

ðŸ’¡ Curiosity keeps me learning and exploring new technologies, allowing me to adapt to ever-evolving development trends. With a keen eye for detail and a commitment to writing clean, maintainable code, I ensure that my applications are not just functional, but also a joy to work with.

ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm diving into serverless architecture and microservices to create even more scalable and resilient applications.
